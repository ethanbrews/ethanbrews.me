<h1>Privacy Policy for Furnace - Minecraft Mod Manager</h1>

<p>The app and it&#39;s developer take privacy seriously. The app uses <a href="https://appcenter.ms/">Visual Studio App Center</a> for analytics and crash reporting. The Microsoft privacy policy can be found <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement">here</a>.</p>

<p>The data collected is used to detect crashes and what caused them (eg: App crashed when pressing a specific button).
	The analytics data is used in order to better understand which features are being used by users to be able to make better development decisions to improve the app for the most users.
	The data collected by the app will never be sold or rented. If you would prefer that your data is not collected, app analytics and crash reporting can be turned off in settings.</p>

<p>All data collected by the app is anonymous. If you choose to, you may reveal an identifier to the developer that would help diagnose a specific crash or issue, but otherwise the data is not linked to you.</p>

<p>You are subject to the terms of service and privacy policy of any pack repositories that you connect the app to. In most cases, you will be notified of this in the app before adding a repository.</p>
